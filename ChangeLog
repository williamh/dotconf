[2003 08 22] [v1.1.0]
    *** BROKE BACKWARDS COMPATABILITY ****
    - new option type: ARG_DOUBLE. let dot.conf read your favorite float or double values


[2003 06 25] [v1.0.13]
    - James Cassidy sent in a little patch to add a 'pkg-config' file
    - Bastian Kleineidam sent in a patch for better support of 64bit architectures

[2003 02 22] [v1.0.12]
    - Joost Remijn of eidetica.com sent in a patch fixing a nasty realloc()
      bug

[2002 09 25] [v1.0.11]
	- Preston Smith fixed the compilation for systems where 'char' is
	  handled as 'unsigned char' (like ARM)
      (for infos see http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/docs/faqs/signedchar.shtml)

[2002 09 17]
	- Ross Alexander of NEC Europe sent in two patches to dotconf.m4, fixing
	  version handling and prefix usage

[2002 05 28] [v1.0.10]
    - a small fix for all RPM users out there. dotconf up to 1.0.9 did not put
      /usr/lib/libdotconf.so into the binary package

[2002 02 04] [v1.0.9]
    - some more examples have been written: noinline, fallback and a
      sophisticated "duplicates" example.
    - FIX: tiny fix for error-reporting when using DUPLICATE_OPTIONS-NAMES
	   (all of the DUPLICATE_OPTION_NAMES stuff has been written by Joost Remijn)

[2002 01 30] [pre v1.0.9]
    - FIX: in v1.0.8a i got the NO_INLINE_COMMENT handling completely wrong.
      this is yet another try to get it right...

           Schulze of mediaways.net sent in the fix for this bug.
    - Joost Remijn of eidetica.com sent in a patch to support

      it uses the context_checker feature to distinguish which module is
      responsible for handling the current line.
    - applied two cleanup patches by Joost Remijn of eidetica.com
    - more general code cleanups

[2002 01 21] [v1.0.8a]
    - in v1.0.7 we fixed the inline comment handling. someone used this bug as
      a feature. we give them a new flag "NO_INLINE_COMMENT", to make this bug
      a feature on demand

[2002 01 15] [v1.0.8]
    - Benjamin Lee sent in a dotconf.spec to create RPMs.

[2001 08 14]
     WIN32 Fixes by Robert Buck:
       - include readdir.[ch] from Apache Software Foundation to support
         multifile-includes introduced in v1.0.4

  This product includes software developed by the
  Apache Software Foundation (http://www.apache.org/).


[2001 07 26] [v1.0.5]
  - FIXED: segmentation fault for ARG_INT and ARG_TOGGLE in the case of a
           missing argument
           This bug was isolated by Ural Khassanov <ural@uwc.ufanet.ru>
           The fix also introduces usage of ERR_WRONG_ARG_COUNT for some
  - FIXED: memory leaks resulting from obscure and confusing if-branches.
           some if-statements have been cleaned up too.
  - FIXED: memory leaks created by buffer-bounds confusion in
           dotconf_substitute_env
  - FIXED: the argument counter was wrong in case of ARG_STR+here-document
  - FIXED: off-by-1 error in examples/module.c's, which lead to a
           memory leak, b/c dlclose() was not called properly

[2001 07 03] [v1.0.4]
  Stephen W. Boyer of caldera.com sent in patches which add
      - support for apache compatible wildcard-matching for Include statements
        (e.g. now you can use "Include /etc/httpd/modules/*.conf")
      - an extern "C" {} block to FIX libpool.h for C++ projects

[2001 06 20] [v1.0.3]

      - FIXED: usage of ContextChecker and/or ErrorHandler for Included files.
      - FIXED: usage of Includepath without setting $DC_INCLUDEPATH

  - dotconf_cleanup failed to free() the memory allocated for
    the include path  [Mike Swieton spotted this]

[2001 03 23] [v1.0.2]
   Shane Wegner of debian.org sent in patches to correct these errors:
      - fix an autoconf build issue

      - fix dotconf-config to report the correct version number now

[2001 02 21] [v1.0.0 (stable)]
      - enhanced version of the context example (examples/context/*)
	this version shows how to create options that are _only_ available in
        global context.
      - applied an aix compile time fix patch submitted by
	Eduardo Marcel Macan <macan@colband.com.br>
      - fixed the behaviour when more than CFG_VALUES arguments where passed,
        which would overflow the parameter buffer.
      - update documentation (doc/*.txt)
      - the manpage is hopelessly outdated and will not be installed anymore

[2000 10 05]
      - some typos corrected in doc/

[2000 10 03] [v1.0.0pre2]
      - dotconf.h-callback_types.diff applied which puts enum callback_types
        to where it belongs. thanx to _Dimitry Bukin_ for providing the patch!

[2000 09 30] [v1.0.0pre1]
      - 5 examples are available; ranging from simple to quite sophisticated
      - libpool - a simple memory management library added to the dist

[2000 09 24]
      - complete API redesign is finished;
****    backward-compatibility is totally and completely broken!!
        see the doc/ directory for more information


[2000 02 23] [v0.7.0]
CAUTION: - config_read call has changed. it additionally takes a flags
           argument now; with this one can change the runtime behaviour
           of dot.conf to for instance recognize options case insensitive
         - config_warning takes 2 additional arguments too;
           the first one is the warning type which has been implemented with
           the syslog warning levels in mind (as suggested by Sander Steffann)
           and the second argument now is some error number to help an
           errorhandler determine what to filter out (see manpage for details)
      - introduction of config_callback to for instance register your own
        errorhandler, which can decide what to print or ignore
      - added macro CFG_TOGGLED to dotconf.h because i wanted to
      apply the original toggle check to an ARG_LIST value
      - updated the manpage to reflect the improvements

[2000 02 09] [v0.6.2]
      - fixed the package to contain the win32.zip

[2000 01 30] [v0.6.1]
      - <red-eye@usa.net> fixed a memory allocation error with module
      registrations
      - <red-eye@usa.net> error checking and changes for win32 (tested
      with VC++ 6.0)
      - license change from GPL 2.0 to LGPL 2.1

[2000 01 28] [v0.6.0]
      - added functionality for ARG_NAME: have dotconf use your ARG_NAME
      callback as a fallback for yet unknown options. [ or use dot.conf as
      a plain parser and do the real stuff yourself => apache mime.types ;) ]
      - the provided example may now be called with an argument which is
      then used as the configuration file rather than 'sample.conf'

      [2000 01 26]
      - added some macros for convenience: FUNC_ARGNONE, FUNC_ARGINT,
      FUNC_ARGSTR, FUNC_ARGRAW, FUNC_ARGLIST, FUNC_ARGNAME, FUNC_ARGTOGGLE
      these macros convenciently help you choose the right function
      definition/declaration
      [2000 01 24]
      - changed config_register_options() to allow unlimited number of
        'registrations'
      [2000 01 23]
      - the elements given to the ARG_LIST callback can now safely be walked
        through with     for(i=0; data[i]; i++)
      [2000 01 22]
      - added "config_warning" to conveniently print warnings to stderr
        including the dotconf_line and dotconf_file information
      - bugfix that correctly resets and restores the line numbering
        when Including files
      - dotconf_line and dotconf_file are now declared extern in
        dotconf.h so that the programmer does not have to do this

[2000 01 21] [v0.5.2]
      - further support for environment variable substitution
      ( ${NAME:-default} )

[2000 01 20] [v0.5.1]
      - the environment variable DC_INCLUDEPATH overrides any setting
        made by using 'IncludePath' in a config-file

[2000 01 19] [v0.5]
      - the internal parser function (config_parse) is not static anymore
      - indentation of options is now supported

[2000 01 13] [v0.4]
      - dotconf_file added for access currently parsed file
      - support for here-documents for options of type ARG_STR
      - support for on-the-fly inclusion of configuration files
        (magic-option Include)
        filenames must be fully qualified, or must be relative
        to the include path (magic-option IncludePath)
        => see included example for usage of all new features
      - updated man page to inform about the new features of course

[2000 01 06] [v0.3]
      - name changed from "libconfig" to "dot.conf"
      - autoconf build system
      - man page update to reflect the new features
      - dot.conf supports you in having dynamically loadable modules
        create their own configuration options now (see example)

[2000 01 04] [v0.2]
      - ARG_NONE actually works now
      - the parser is more forgiving regarding whitespace between two
        arguments to an ARG_LIST type option
      - change local variable line to be exported as libconfig_line
      - extended example.c to show the how to use libconfig_line
        and ARG_STR as well as ARG_LIST are now used in the example
      - updated the man page of course

[1999 12 30] [v0.1]
      - initial release v0.1
